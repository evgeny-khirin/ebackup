Fault tolerant system for management of semi-structured data.
-------------------------------------------------------------

Storage:
* True 64-bits storage manager handles 16 exbibytes of storage without
  loss of performance.
* Storage supported - OS files, raw disks, raid arrays, pool of disks, pool
  of computers, pools with software raid, cloud storage, whatever else...
* Hot storage adding in running system without restart. Added storage will be
  available for application immediately without delay.
* Custom client API to storage manager.

Database:
* Number of tables in database is limited by available storage only.
* Size of single database table is limited by available storage only.
* Database table is B-tree with variable records length. Record consists of
  key-value tuple. Max record size is about 2G. Real max size may be
  limited by memory, available for application. There is no restrictions
  on size of key or value within each record and within table. It is
  possible to mix records of different sizes in same table.
* There is no restrictions on type of keys and values stored in database.
  It is possible to mix keys and values of different types in same table.
* Page size is any in range from 75 bytes up to 4GB. Real max size may be
  limited by memory, available for application.
* Built-in data compression.
* Custom client API to database.

Transactions support:
* Full ACID.
* Transactions isolation level - serial. Support of isolation levels is
  extendable.
* Transactions durability support - survives system crashes, power failures
  and media crashes. In case of media crash, restore is possible from complete
  log or from partial log + replica.
* Custom transaction log management.
* X/Open distributed transaction processing interface can be provided.
* Custom client API to transaction manager.
