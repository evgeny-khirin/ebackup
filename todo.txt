1. Move SPC from https to sockets with RSA + AES encryption.
	Key exchange algorithm:
	1. Client asks server for public key.
	2. Server responds with public key. The key is signed by
	   server with EB_CMN_DSS_PRIVATE_KEY.
	3. In order to make data of first requests random, they are encrypted with
	   some hardcoded key using eklib:aes_128_encrypt.
	4. Client verifies public key with EB_CMN_DSS_PUBLIC_KEY.
	5. Client generates its session key, encrypts it with public key and
	   sends to server.
	6. Server generates its session key, encrypts it with client's session key and
	   sends it to client.
	7. Now client and server exchanged the keys.

2. Update laptop support from http://www3.sympatico.ca/cautiontape//vostro/.
